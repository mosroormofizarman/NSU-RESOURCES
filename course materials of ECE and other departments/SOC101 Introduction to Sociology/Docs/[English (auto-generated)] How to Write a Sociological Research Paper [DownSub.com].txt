hello I am Jared right this is a video

ten minute video presentation for my

teaching sociology class our assignment

was to do a presentation on something

sociological so I've decided to be a

little original about it I want to just

talk about how to write a good

sociological research paper because this

is something that is really not taught a

lot in classes especially in

undergraduate classes we tend to rely

more on English and literature classes

to teach people how to write but for me

personally I never really understood how

to write a good research paper until

probably just last year I think it

really finally clicked in my mind the

the actual structure and process of it

and ever since then it's been a lot

easier for me and I'm a lot more

confident than my ability to write

research papers so I just want to go

through some of these ideas briefly to

begin with the first and probably most

important step is forming a good

research question we all have lots of

questions we want to answer but a good

appropriate research question for a

research paper is very important so to

start with you need this sort of

amorphous green blob here this is a

represents just coming up with it with a

general topic that you're interested in

and this can be anything sociological

you could be interested in studying

gender or religion or in my case social

movements this is just a very broad

topic of interest most people have

something they're interested in at least

that they would like to research so just

start with that nice and easy

but then second you're going to want to

hone in on something specific within

that broader category so this can be a

specific issue or a specific events

let's say with gender you want to study

gendered relations between parents and

children like how they treat sons

differently than daughters or in my case

social movements let's say I want to

pick a specific event I could decide I

want to do a study on the Occupy central

protests in

Hong Kong did have been taking place

since last year

that's something relatively new that

hasn't been studied much so there's

there's definitely some some room there

and then the third part again forming

your research question is to come up

with a unique theoretical perspective

this little drawing represents this is

an eye that's looking at the thing so

that's the the perspective of the theory

and of course the perspective is driven

by theory you're going to need to read

other studies that have been done to see

what kind of theories have been used and

what kind of theories have not yet been

used and that will help you form and

decide what kind of theory you want to

employ and how you want to look at this

issue so for example with the Occupy

central protests I could you know from

what I've read about the protests I know

that there's a lot of police repression

in China it's not a very open society in

terms of of protests so one thing that

the protesters have done quite a bit is

they've had to come up with new tactics

of protests to evade and get around

police repression so in one case they

actually have used a lot of large number

of protesters have used umbrellas to

block pepper spray from police and some

people have even taken to calling it the

umbrella revolution as a result so based

on what I've learned there from reading

about it I could decide I want to use

McAdams theory of tactical innovation to

look at these protests to see how the

protesters are innovating new tactics in

order to stay one step ahead of the

police and keep from being repressed in

that way so that would be my theoretical

perspective but really you can pick any

kind of theory that's appropriate for

whatever it is that you're studying in

an important part of coming up with

these research questions also is

identifying gaps in the existing

literature there's three types of gaps

that you can exploit basically to come

up with something original either

an original issue or event that hasn't

been studied before or picking an

original theoretical perspective that

hasn't been applied to a specific issue

or event yet or a new one altogether or

third just picking an original data

source if you have original data you can

use an existing issue or event and then

even an existing theoretical perspective

but study it using a new source of data

to either verify or argue against other

studies that have been done so that's

very important is to find an opening

find something that that hasn't been

done exactly the way you want to do it

quite yet and so then you can make your

argument and add to the existing

literature in some way now for the

structure of the research paper itself

this is one of the most useful parts of

this lecture research papers can be very

daunting oftentimes when you go into it

you're thinking wow I'm going to write

this 15 you know 10 15 page sometimes

even 20 page paper that seems like quite

a bit especially if you're not used to

writing papers of that way so hopefully

this will help by breaking it down into

sections and showing you exactly what

these sections need to consist of first

of all you want to start with your

introduction now

introductions typically about two pages

this is an estimate though it can be you

know a little bit longer or a little bit

shorter just depending you want to start

your introduction by presenting the

problem or the issue or the event or

whatever it is that you're writing about

just sort of laying it out what it is

and you want to follow that up with

stating the importance of that problem

and this is this is critical because you

want to give people a reason to read

your paper this is the classic so what

question of Sociology you know you want

you want people to have a reason to

spend the time to go through and read

all of these pages that you've written

so you need to state emphatically what

the importance of this issue is for

example with occupy central I could say

this can have repercussions for other

social movements this

can have reproductions for the political

structure of China in the future you

know there's all these very important

implications as a result of what's going

on here now after you've introduced your

subject and stated the importance of it

you want to give a broad statement of

what your goals of the paper are this is

not as specific as your research

questions but something more general

like you know I this paper will explore

the dynamics between police and protests

or something like that just kind of a

general idea and you want to go over

give it a brief overview of the steps

that you're going to take through the

paper as you address the problem which

you might want to go back and write

after you finish the paper actually

it'll be a bit easier to do it that way

next is the literature review this is

one of the longer sections of the paper

about three to five pages I would

estimate start with the exploring and

explaining similar previous work that's

been done and there's two things you

want to identify here first is stepping

stones which is other work other

theories that you can build off of and

the third I'm sorry the second then are

gaps which are openings which are things

that have not yet been explored that you

want to fill yourself and then after

that after you've explored existing work

you want to lay out your theoretical

framework that you're going to use in

your paper as you explore your data and

then you want to end your literature

review typically it's at the end where

you state your specific research

questions and this could be one question

or it could be you know two or three

questions just depending on what you're

looking at the next section is your

methods section this is typically only

about one or two pages you just want to

describe how you're collecting your data

where the data is coming from how your

what type of sampling strategy you're

using and how you're going to analyze

the data and this can vary widely

whether you're doing quantitative or

qualitative study you're using

statistical analysis or if you're just

doing some interviews or something like

that

next then is your results section here

this is about two to three pages this

can be a lot longer if you're doing some

kind of quantitative analysis though and

here you just lay out the specific

results of your data analysis you don't

want to interpret your results or

theorize much here because that comes in

the next section here you just want to

state the specific cut-and-dry results

of your study the next section is

discussion which is also about two to

three pages here you want to explain and

interpret the results from the previous

section you also want to talk about the

implications again it's this so what

question why are these results important

what does this mean in the bigger

picture why should we care and you also

want to in this section talking about

the limitations of your study any

drawbacks any data that you couldn't

access any any limitation that was in

the study you want to be very upfront

about it because if you're not

somebody's going to catch it eventually

and call you out probably and that's

going to be even worse so just be honest

and upfront about any limitations that

you encounter during the course of the

study if you're doing a qualitative

study too sometimes your results in your

discussion section can be combined let's

say you're doing interviews then you can

actually kind of do those as the same

section they don't have to be excuse me

specifically distinct sections there now

in fact for qualitative work people

oftentimes combine those and then last

of all your conclusion which is only

about one page maybe two at the most

oh okay get in my lab Wow and here you

just want to give a summary of of what

you've written about of what you found

and what your theories were and

typically what you find is the first or

second paragraph of the summary ends up

becoming the abstract of the paper and

you'll notice this if you go back and if

you read other studies you know look at

their first or second paragraph

their conclusion and it's oftentimes

very very similar to the abstract itself

so this is just you just want to

summarize generally what you did and

what you found in your paper and think

of it in terms of that abstract that one

paragraph kind of summary and then you

also want to end with suggesting

directions for future research talk

about what other people can do or what

you would like to do that you weren't

able to do in this study that's always a

big big help for research because we

want to do more research so if you want

to keep that door open for other people

to follow up so in summary we have these

six sections of the paper each section

itself is actually not that long but in

the end when you put them all together

you end up with you know about a 10 to

20 page paper coming out of that so it

really helps to think about it

I think broken down in these ways and

yeah I hope that's a that's beneficial

and helpful if for everyone and let me

know if you have any questions Thanks
