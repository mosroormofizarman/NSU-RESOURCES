hello world it's Suraj and how are you

supposed to write a great research paper

I've written and read my fair share of

research papers and I'm going to outline

the steps you can take to write one

whether you're a PhD candidate at MIT or

a freshman in high school maybe you're

working on a blockchain project and once

you have an initial coin offering or you

found that the model you built in Karros

and left training overnight managed to

beat the state-of-the-art because of a

simple tweak you made to some hyper

parameters whatever it is you should

publish your findings so before you

start your journey you got to remind

yourself to stay positive research can

be hard

it can take long hours require tons of

time studying and experimenting with no

good results in fact you might find that

you were asking the wrong questions all

along and you need to start from scratch

and that's okay to become world-class

and anything you do it's gonna take more

than just knowledge like an Olympic

athlete aiming for the gold medal you've

got to have a positive attitude and the

belief that you have the ability to

discover something awesome that's the

real start to writing a compelling paper

then you've got to come up with a topic

start by coming up with some questions

you have about the field that you're

studying they can be broad they can be

specific they can be embarrassing

whatever just come up with a list of

questions that you personally want to

know the answers to and then try to find

the answer to those questions for

yourself to a level that you feel

comfortable with and would enable you to

teach others talk to some people and see

what they think

to verify that you do indeed understand

the answer to your questions that could

mean posting your understanding to a

subreddit or to Stack Overflow or a

slack Channel as a result of searching

for an answer to your questions you'll

either find an answer in the form of

existing work or you won't find an

answer which means you found a good area

for further research now what are the

related subtopic

to this question start narrowing down

the broader the question the harder it

will be to answer it's much much much

harder to solve a question like what is

consciousness over a question like what

is a more optimal strategy to generate

suitable distributions for a Monte Carlo

tree search in the words of Kendrick you

got to sit down

and be humble a well-articulated paper

that's laser focused on a solution to a

niche problem is much more useful to the

community than an ambiguous solution to

a broad problem the next step is to

collect your data on this topic you're

gonna get a lot of articles blog posts

tutorials videos and PDFs when you

google it you'll need to go through each

of these systematically but remember not

all sources are created equal just as

it's important to be able to search

through a wide variety of sources it's

also just as important to learn to be

critical in your assessment a source

could have a possible political or

monetary bias so pay attention to who

wrote it their qualifications why they

wrote it and when it was produced to see

how up-to-date it is pay attention to

the domain extension dot edu sand dot

Govs can be more reliable sources than

coms which could be pushing content that

persuades you to purchase something

ideally you find empirical research that

is knowledge gained through direct or

indirect observation of experience

popular journals conference submissions

even social media like subreddit and

facebook groups have people sharing

relevant research daily Google Scholar

is another good way to find papers just

make sure to be specific in your

keywords so they relate to your topic if

you find a paper you really like that

seems relevant go ahead and jot down

some of the cited sources it lists you

can find those later and use those as

well for your own research now you're

ready to feel to learn find yourself a

cozy spot that you feel comfortable in

and start learning from your sources try

to make generalizations you are the

you are taking different ideas from

different sources and putting them

together in a way that no one has

thought of before

for whatever reason you'll find common

ideas across different projects some

will have more successful

implementations of those ideas than

others this can take anywhere from a

single day to several weeks after this

synthesis of data you'll come to some

kind of belief some kind of possible

solution that you think might work for

your problem use this as your thesis

this is a declaration of your belief

based on the data your paper will be you

defending that belief through a series

of compelling arguments based on your

own results as well as the results of

others and don't worry too much about

having it be finalized your thesis will

naturally change as you experiment and

develop your ideas ask for validation of

your thesis from people well-versed in

your topic you don't want to spend your

valuable time researching something if

it's not a good idea

email paper authors directly or ask your

question on relevant social media

platforms once your thesis is validated

go ahead and try to solve the problem

it's really easy to get bogged down in

one implementation detail or carefully

tuning the wrong algorithm to avoid this

your first goal should be to get

something super super basic in place as

quickly as possible that solves the

problem then once you've got a

functional baseline you can get creative

I actually learned this technique from

the Google glass team recipes

once you feel comfortable with your

solution it's time to start writing an

outline look at papers related to your

thesis and see what kind of subsections

they've listed a lot of times you'll

find some common subsection headings

between different papers go ahead and

create a list of subsections that are a

generalized form of the related papers

then think about if there are any extra

sub sections you might want to add that

are specific to your project or even

some that you might

to take away generally the format for an

outline should start with a title then

an abstract which will summarize your

work then an introduction that will give

the reader some of your motivations and

background data the methodology will

document your research process then your

results a discussion at the end

weighing all the different results a

conclusion that uses the results to

answer your thesis and finally

references which will cite your sources

once you've done all of that you're

ready to write your first draft welcome

to the world of technical writing this

is the art of writing about a technical

topic in an engaging informative and

educating way you are being of service

to the larger scientific community by

writing this paper so don't try to sound

smart for the sake of sounding smart

rather get your point across in the most

efficient way possible

using language that ideally your reader

already understands go into excruciating

detail explaining every single bit of

your work every reference everything

it's much easier to cut down a long

paper than to continually try to add

more to it to make it seem longer the

ideal length for a paper is between 5 to

10 pages any less and you aren't being

detailed enough and anymore and it's

going to be a bit too long to maintain

the interests of the reader support

every statement you make with evidence

and never never never plagiarize the

whole point of this paper is to show the

synthesis of the ideas you've learned

about in your own words and it's always

better to show than to tell use tools

like OmniGraffle and Inkscape to create

graphs charts and conceptual diagrams to

help illustrate your line of thinking

the flow of your paper should have all

of the subsections appear interconnected

rather than starting and stopping in a

blunt way from one topic to the next

smoothly sag into the next topic don't

be too harsh on yourself the first draft

just get something anything

just let it out you can iterate on it

later if you spend too much time trying

to make it perfect on the first go

you'll never get anything out so just

crank it out and iterate remember only

you are reviewing this thing at first

once you've got your first draft

congratulations you are awesome

time to revise first go through your

paper and check for content errors

anything having to do with grammar

misspelled words etc then check for

factual errors or your numbers correct

double and triple check them you might

find once you've written a first draft

that rearranging your ideas would be

more beneficial to having a compelling

argument that one idea is actually a

dependency of another so it's better to

place it afterwards

in fact entire subsections could be

rearranged to make the paper flow better

eventually after some mixing and

matching and revising you'll have a

final draft you can then add some

optional content if you'd like like a

table of contents at the beginning or an

appendix at the end once you've done all

of this you can submit your paper to a

popular journal like nature or a popular

subreddit for your scientific community

or even just github the point of this is

to get your research in front of as many

eyeballs as possible and get them to

learn from your work it's kind of hard

to get a paper accepted in some of the

top journals as the peer-review process

can be very very thorough basically the

journal will ask a few other scientists

well-versed in your topic to validate

your claims to ensure the integrity and

soundness of your work but if they

accept it getting published in one of

these journals is an extra credential

for your paper it gives it more

technical authority amongst the

community are you ready to become the

next Alan Turing yet hit subscribe to

continue to level up your learning game

and

now I've got to hone my craft so thanks

for watching
