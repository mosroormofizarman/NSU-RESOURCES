in this introduction to the discipline

of sociology dr. Laurie peek overviews

the focus history and approach of

sociological inquiry she defines

sociology as the systematic study of

society and the associate ocol

perspective as one that analyzes

patterns of individuals experiences she

identifies several foundational thinkers

including compt Marx Weber and Durkheim

and describes the major theoretical

approaches that derived from them

she also focuses on methodological

aspects of sociology defining the scales

at which sociologists work and the

differences between quantitative and

qualitative data gathering and analysis

she highlights some key sociological

concepts including structure and agency

social stratification and inequality

she ends by discussing the future of

sociology and highlights the move toward

interdisciplinary work and new

methodologies to address wicked problems

thanks for giving me the opportunity to

open this all up and so we decided in

our planning that we would launch this

workshop with just a brief sort of 30

minute overview of what is sociology

because that's the perspective that

we're going to be focusing on for the

next few days so anyone who has ever

considered becoming a sociologist or who

is a sociologist has had this question

posed of them whether it be from their

parents as they're trying to decide

whether they're going to become a

sociology major or whether they're at a

cocktail party somebody inevitably once

you say hi I'm Laurie pique and I'm a

sociologist at Colorado State University

follows that statement with what is

sociology anyway and if the sociologists

in the room are anything like me they

oftentimes sort of stare vaguely out the

window and kind of say something like

well it's a study of human life or maybe

we'll say something like it's the study

of society or something general like

that and that oftentimes leads people to

sort of either glaze over or to look

quite confused what does that what are

those kind of broad statements even mean

and so then we

you what people oftentimes do when

people look at us in a confused kind of

way we use more words because we think

if we say more things inevitably they're

going to just sort of nod and smile and

walk away and go get a drink

and so then sometimes we say things like

this we'll say well it's a systematic

study of human behavior or social

interaction social institutions and

society and so one of the challenges

with starting any kind of lecture like

this with defining what is sociology

what is our discipline is that maybe

it's hard to define it because sociology

is almost everything that when we talk

about the study of society and of human

life there is almost no point in history

there's almost no space in our around

our globe there's almost no group or

community or or type of organization of

social life that sociologists have not

considered in their work and so the very

breadth of what it is that we do makes

defining what we do very difficult

another thing that I would argue makes

defining sociology somewhat difficult is

that the bounds of what we do are not

always so clear and that has led some

social scientists argue that maybe a

better definition of sociology might be

that it's actually a perspective or an

approach and so Kai Erikson who is one

of our most distinguished sociologists

and the son of Erik Erikson and the

psychologist says this he says the fact

is that most sociologists regard their

field as an approach rather than simply

as a subject matter it's a perspective

rather than a clear body of knowledge

what differentiates us from other

observers of the human scene is how we

look out at the world the way our eyes

are focused the way our intellectual

reflexes are set the way our

imaginations are tuned and so if we said

something like that at said cocktail

party we would probably be followed on

with well then what is a sociological

perspective and so another way that I've

heard Chi when he's trying to talk about

what socio

elegy is another metaphor that he is

used or analogy is that if you want to

think about what is a sociological

perspective think about the following so

who was it in here who lives in New York

we have a couple of people who've lived

in New York so how many of you have been

to New York ever okay so most of us so

think about what your experience is

walking along the streets of New York

City a big city a diversity a

cosmopolitan city if all of us were

walking together along the streets of

New York City at street level we would

encounter a number of individuals and we

would see those individuals we would see

the contours and textures of their faces

the clothing they were wearing the pace

at which they were walking and we might

begin to make up things about those

people we might imagine that the man in

the middle in the yellow shirt with the

bag over his shoulder he may be rushing

along to work well the man slightly

behind him holding the H&M bag we may

assume that he has a day off or maybe

he's a tourist who's come to this city

to shop and so at that ground level we

see the biography and we see and we

imagine things about individual stories

and life histories but what cases if you

want to understand a sociological

perspective what you might have to do is

go to one of the many many tall

buildings that ring New York City and

you would climb up maybe let's say we

climbed up to the 14th floor and then if

we look down on that city all of a

sudden we would no longer see individual

faces we would no longer see the

clothing or the contours of one's face

instead what we would begin to see our a

series of patterns and in fact it might

be astonishing to us exactly how

patterned something that moments before

seemed chaotic and incredibly diverse

from the 14th floor all of a sudden we'd

start to realize the color of the cars

and how frequently the color is yellow

we might start to see how pattern people

are in terms of when they stopped at a

street corner and when they begin to

walk and how they move and how they

shift and so forth and so that's one way

thinking about what do sociologists do

it's not that we're not interested in

the individual perspectives and

biographies but much of what we're

trying to do is to figure out these

patterns and these conditions that help

make society work or what are the

patterns and conditions that are present

when society doesn't function or doesn't

work now another way of thinking about

the sociological perspective was put

forth by one of our classic thinkers

Searight Mills who he talked about the

sociological perspective or in his words

the imagination as a vivid awareness of

the relationship between personal

experience and the brighter broader or

wider society in which individuals are

embedded in order to work on our

sociological perspectives and to try to

understand this influence we're going to

turn to a specific social issue or

social problem that sociologists have

spent a lot of time trying to understand

from a lot of different perspectives and

so we're going to talk a little bit

about homelessness and so I'd like all

of you for just a moment I would like

you to consider the following question

and so I want you to take let's just say

35 seconds and I want you to brainstorm

as many factors as you possibly can that

would help explain why does a person

become homeless

so to back to see right mills and how he

teaches us about the sociological

perspective so one of the things that he

and other sociologists oftentimes write

about and recognize is that the United

States on sort of there are lots of

scales that sociologists have developed

to look at societies that range from

highly individualistic societies to much

more collectivist societies in terms of

their orientation and the United States

usually on almost any of those scales or

measures we fall very far on the

individualistic side that oftentimes

when we see challenges or troubles or

issues in people's lives

we oftentimes attribute those challenges

or issues to matters of individual

biography and so what that sometimes

translates into is that when we see an

individual person on the street a

homeless person we pass him or her by

that we might sort of start making a lot

of assumptions that this person came

from a broken home or this person is an

addict or this person is mentally ill

and those things we know oftentimes are

true that the biggest drivers of

homelessness in the United States

include things like mental illness and

things like lack of social ties and

being from broken families and also

addiction and so forth and so sometimes

we focus in on that individual actor but

what Mills asked us to also do in order

to develop our sociological perspective

is to also think about the history and

the context in which that person is

embedded as well as social structures

and political structures and economic

structures that may influence whether or

not a person becomes homeless and so in

addition to a person's biography we

might want to think about in this

context what is the history of

homelessness in the United States when

have there been other moments when

homelessness has been it incredibly

exceptionally high rates or when has it

been at a lower rate what's going on

right now in the United States we're

living in a particular historical moment

our child homelessness is at the highest

rate that has ever been in our national

history and so all of a sudden you start

putting this personal trouble into

larger context we also might try to

start understanding our social economic

and political structures to understand

homelessness so we might look at things

like poverty level and try to connect

how does the level of poverty in a given

society as well as the availability of

affordable housing how did those aspects

influence who may or may not become

homeless as well as social and political

policies and then what mills would say

in order to have a fully developed

sociological perspective that we must

take all of these things into account

our biographies our histories and our

social structures and one of the things

he said in his classic work was the

following when in a city of a hundred

thousand only one man is unemployed that

is his personal trouble and for its

relief we properly looked to the

character of the man his skills and his

immediate opportunities but when in a

nation of 50 million employees 15

million men are unemployed that is an

issue and we may not hope to find its

solution within the range of

opportunities open to any one individual

and so this is something to the

questions that were raised earlier this

morning that we're going to continue I

think throughout this entire workshop is

that balance between agency or

individual action and then broader

social structures okay and so now a few

words on the history and emergence of

our discipline and so a gas comped

oftentimes is credited as being the

founder founding father of sociology

largely because he was the first one to

use the term he was a French philosopher

and he was very very concerned with

taking and applying the methods and the

Natural Sciences many of the methods

that many of you are all quite attuned

to taking those methods and then trying

to apply them to the quote-unquote

objective study of society and much of

comp's work was focused on trying to

identify social laws or things that he

argued would hold across time and space

and in order to identify social laws he

argued that we needed to identify both

what he called social statics or

structures or institutions that remain

in place so these may be things like

education the health care institution

the family religion and so forth so

thinking about social statics and then

also thinking about social dynamics or

how do those structures and institutions

change across time and space he was not

incredibly successful at identifying

social laws and in fact many people have

sort of abandoned this idea that there

are social laws that are akin to the

laws that we might have in physics for

example but his work was obviously

critical to the establishment of our

discipline Marx Weber and Durkheim are

largely considered our big three

founding fathers of sociology when I was

preparing for this talk one of the

questions that was raised during one of

our meetings was sort of that question

of what are the things that if you are a

capital s sociologists that that's the

badge that you get to wear around as if

you're Superman or superwoman if you

have that cape that you're wearing

around what are the things that all

sociologists if I meet Andrew no matter

where he's from in the world no matter

where he is trained that there are

certain assumptions that we may hold and

one of those assumption is that if we're

both capital s sociologists that we at

some point in our training have been

exposed to these big three that they are

our foundational thinkers and we're

going to have an entire session led by

Tom on these three thinkers following on

to this and so just briefly to give sort

of an overview and why they're so

important and so Durkheim was a French

sociologist and he wrote several very

very influential empirical studies

including suicide the division of labor

in society and also the rules of the

sociological method and he is really

associated with the functionalist

tradition which I'm going to elaborate

on that momentarily and some of the

things and these are just some sort of

highlights takeaways if there was a quiz

after this some

you might associate with Durkheim is his

idea of social facts that he believed

that there are pattern ways of acting

thinking and feeling that exists outside

of us as individuals and then exert

control over us and so he was very

concerned with trying to identify sort

of a coup akin to comps laws what are

the social facts that exists in our

society and influence us he also was

very concerned with identifying

different forms of social solidarity and

so he wrote a lot about mechanical

solidarity or more traditional societies

where people might be considered very

common in their values beliefs and in

terms of their work that they carry out

as opposed to perhaps more advanced

societies that were marked by what he

referred to as organic solidarity or

places that have very diverse divisions

of labour and he also read a lot about

anomie or what happens when societies

cease to have social control and what

happens when we our values come into

conflict with one another so Marx who we

already heard his name this morning and

often times sociologists get affiliated

with Karl Marx and his work for good or

for bad he was actually an economist and

a philosopher and is largely associated

with the conflict tradition within

sociology and unlike Durkheim who was

very very concerned with the social

order and the functioning of things Marx

believed that he wrote much more

extensively about conflict over capital

and how the bourgeoisie or the moneyed

class and the working class might have

conflict and that would ultimately lead

to social change and somewhat similar to

Durkheim's concept of a know me Marx

wrote a lot about alienation or the

feeling of powerlessness that emerges

when individuals or groups are detached

from the means and modes of production

within society now a third great thinker

or classic foundational thinker is Weber

who is a german social scientists and he

was very

in terms of bringing methods into

sociology and bringing this emphasis

that our work should be value free and

should exclude our own personal values

and biases and interests and instead

should focus on the science of what

we're doing he also spent a lot of his

work writing about bureaucracies and the

roles that bureaucracies play in

structuring society but also the dangers

of bureaucracy bureaucracies when

society becomes over bureaucratized so

you've already heard the thinkers dirk i

Durkheim in particular is associated

with the founding of this functionalist

approach as is comped and so when we

think about levels of analysis where are

we if we're climbing up to that 14th

floor functionalist would be think of it

this way so functionalist oftentimes see

society almost like a bicycle wheel and

so they recognize that there are

different parts of society that keep

society moving forward and they're

interested in the interconnection

between those parts and how those parts

operate together conflict theorists are

also working at a macro level

perspective in terms of their work but

they're much more concerned with trying

to understand struggles over scarce

resources power and wealth inequalities

and how people may attempt to accumulate

power or wealth and to hold on to that

once they have it they also look a lot

at which groups benefit from which

policies and practices in society now a

fourth foundational thinker that is

oftentimes included in discussions of

the foundations of society is George

Herbert Mead and he was a philosopher

psychologist and also a sociologist at

the University of Chicago and he brought

a very different sort of perspective or

way of looking to the sociological

tradition and so where whereas Marx

Durkheim and Weber were much more

concerned with these large-scale

structures and institutions

mede was much much more interested in

understanding the more micro level norms

and values that influence our day-to-day

lives and actions in society he's

responsible for introducing notions of

the generalized other role taking and

the I and me and I'm going to speak more

in more depth later this afternoon

during our Theory session on symbolic

interactionism which is the micro level

perspective with which Mead is most

associated but briefly when we talk

about that I he brings so to this

question we had this morning again about

agency and structure what Mead brought

into the discussion was that all of us

have an eye that we can be spontaneous

and creative and free thinking but we

also have a me which is that other focus

self which allows us to understand the

expectations and norms and values that

are oftentimes placed upon us by others

and so what Mead brought into this sort

of when we think about major theoretical

approaches or perspectives this is the

symbolic interactionist approach and

it's at a much more micro level that

sees society as really being composed of

this some of the interactions that it is

people from the ground up who create

society rather than society from the top

down just only encroaching on us as

individuals ok

and so just sort of putting these

different how do we put the macro and

micro paradigms in relation to one

another so some of the core questions

that somebody working from a

functionalist perspective might ask or

what are things like what keeps society

functioning or running what are the

different parts of society and how do

they interconnect or relate to one

another what are the intended and

unintended consequences of a policy or a

practice or the manifest and latent

consequences a conflict theorists on the

other hand may be much more interested

still again working at a macro level

perspective but trying to understand

things like how wealth and power are

distributed evenly or unevenly across

the society how people once they have

wealth and power how they may try to

hold on to her

keep that wealth and power are there

particular groups in society that are

dominating or leading and how did they

get ahead our society's limited

resources divided among different groups

and then a much more micro level

perspective they may ask questions like

how do people co-create society through

their daily interactions their words and

their actions how does social

interaction influence create and sustain

relationships and do people change

behavior from one setting to another in

terms of how they act towards other

people and if so why now somewhere

between these very micro level

perspectives and the much more macro

level perspectives are what sociologists

oftentimes refer to as mezzo or

mid-range theoretical orientations and

these orientations oftentimes focus on

things like organizations institutions

laws particularly and so the

sociologists oftentimes can and do focus

on things like specifically the criminal

justice system as a particular

institution of interest the healthcare

system is a particular institution of

interests religion the family and so

forth and in fact where sociology is at

today in terms of the state of the

discipline and this may be a good point

for discussion

so while sociology oftentimes gets

characterized as either this very sort

of micro level interactional we're going

out and observing people and taking

notes or were these grand theorists

sitting back in our offices that many

people would argue that today's

sociologists for a variety of reasons

oftentimes fit much more in this sort of

mid-level range where sociologists are

oftentimes focusing on a particular

institution or practice or group and

sociologists can and do oftentimes spend

their entire careers in that particular

range and so when we look at where is

the state of a discipline today this is

from our American Sociological

Association website from 2015 and right

now in sociology where we're also at as

a discipline as we are incredibly

diverse and some people

might argue that diversity has brought

fracturing within our community so we

have 52 distinct sections or sub areas

within sociology that people study and

what the numbers are here this is the

section membership and so you can see

that if we try to think about where are

most sociologists working today this

isn't a perfect this isn't a perfect

analysis of that but it certainly is a

proxy to say there are lots of

sociologists who are working in the

areas of sex and gender culture medical

sociology organizations occupation and

work race gender and class and so forth

now something that is definitely um that

is skewed because of this there are lots

of areas where a lot of sociologists

work like criminology and the criminal

justice system for example tends to be

the field within sociology where we have

the most hires but it's not accurately

represented here because there's an

entire society called the American

criminological society or a CJ S or

something along those lines and sorry if

I just messed that up but that is a

whole other separate organization but

that's also a major area in sociology

and then you can see the much smaller

sections over there that are oftentimes

newer now how do sociologists do what it

is that they do and so most basically

and Andrews going to talk to you about

this shortly this morning when we do our

research we tend to either do it using

numbers so we do quantitative research

or we do qualitative research that's

much more interpretive and looking at

patterns and relationships and so

specific methods that social scientists

and sociologists in particular

oftentimes use include we do surveys and

in my own work I've done online surveys

mail surveys door-to-door surveys and

phone surveys and so with each one of

these methods we oftentimes deploy them

in very different ways but Survey

Research has long been a favorite of

sociologists we also increasingly do a

lot of secondary data analysis using

various data sets to try to answer very

specific questions

sociologists often do content analysis

of everything from pictures that have

been taken to children's storybooks to

analyses of publish print media social

scientists oftentimes use field research

methods as well and so under the

qualitative tradition oftentimes doing

in-depth interviews engaging in

participant observation conducting focus

groups and even using newer and more

creative methods like Photovoice where

you give a child or an adult a camera

and ask them to go take a picture in

response to a prompt also sociologists

sometimes use experimental work as well

doing everything from mailing out

resumes to actually CERN it sending

experimental researchers into the field

to answer particular questions and

sociologists also are increasingly

meeting with our geographer friends and

using more and more spatial analysis as

well as GIS and our work and so one of

the questions as I was preparing this

talk that was posed was how is sociology

different or similar to the other social

scientists and Sciences that are out

there and even this morning someone

asked the question about the

similarities or differences between

sociology and anthropology and so

sociology is certainly on this spectrum

and there is with I would argue with all

of these social scientific traditions

there's oftentimes overlap in terms of

the particular topics questions or

concerns that we may have and so

concerns with labor market inequality

for example concerns with discrimination

in the labor market concerns with things

like religion or hazards or climate

change oftentimes could these big

topical areas could certainly fall into

any one of these disciplines and so in

terms of what is the difference between

a sociologist and a cultural

anthropologist for example so as with

most questions like this the answer is

going to be it depends and so if you are

a qualitative sociologist who engages in

in-depth ethnographic work deeply

embedded in your

unity and doing that kind of qualitative

rich work that cultural anthropology is

oftentimes known for you may be reading

just as much anthropology as you are

sociology and you'll be borrowing

methods you will be borrowing ethical

stances you may be coming from a very

very similar epistemology in terms of

how you approach your work and so in

that case there may not be much

difference at all between that

particular sociologists and a cultural

anthropologist but then because

sociology is so diverse in terms of the

questions posed the methods used and so

forth you would meet another sociologist

including many sitting in this room who

would have nothing in common with that

cultural anthropologists are very little

in common with them and so I think when

that overlap occurs it occurs not just

in the sort of topical interest space

but sometimes it's in the sharing of

methods and so forth and I hope this is

something we can follow on a lot more

with the discussion over the next couple

of days okay and finally just to wrap up

a few things and again this came up in

the questioning this morning so a vague

and enduring date debate that every

graduate student in sociology has at

some point during their graduate

seminars is this question and debate

around structure versus agency and so

this really highlights this ongoing and

and long-term tension within sociology

of trying to understand how much of an

individual's life is indeed determined

by social forces and factors that

surround us and so people coming from

the more agentic perspective might argue

that individuals we are rational beings

who have the ability to take in

information to change our minds to

change our behavior and to ultimately

change our life worlds that we have the

ability to think to verbalize and

ultimately to act that is independent of

whatever structures may be impinging

upon us now the people on the more

structural side would argue that we are

all born into a particular historical

moment we're all born into a particular

cultural and social and political and

economic context that whether we like it

or not whether we want to acknowledge it

or not these pre-existing social

arraignments everything from the

families were born into to the societies

that we live in shape and ultimately

will constrain our behavior to some

extent and so the structure agency to

pay debate is something that is ongoing

and is oftentimes at the center of

things that we talk about as

sociologists also another contribution

of sociology somewhere where a lot of us

have attuned and focused our lenses is

on this issue of social stratification

and so this is referring to the

hierarchical arrangement of social

groups based on their control or power

over basic resources and those resources

may range from natural resources to

economic resources to interpersonal or

social resources who has access to what

in their day-to-day life in terms of

knowledge and information and so forth

and so when sociologists look at social

stratification much of our analysis is

centered around it's hard to get a lot

of sociology published if you don't take

into account what are the class gender

race age and so forth differences in

what it is that you're looking at and

just finally a few thoughts and again I

hope that this is something we'll be

talking about and debating over the

coming days where we at sort of in terms

of the present and future of sociology

and so in 1967 churchmen published a

really seminal article on this idea of

wicked problems and one thing that I

think is happening with sociology as a

discipline is that we have long focus on

wicked problems or problems that are

complex they're changing they're hard to

grasp and they're highly contested and

so when you read about wicked problems

in today's debates they oftentimes our

Center on climate change hazards that

ongoing HIV pandemic in certain parts of

the world other public health crises and

so forth

these are all challenges and issues that

sociologists have long been attuned to

and related to this because wicked

problems are by their very definition

complex they are not centered in

particular disciplinary or geographic

boundaries increasingly sociologists for

a variety of reasons including funding

reasons as well as other other drivers

are doing more and more multi and

interdisciplinary work also sociologists

are engaging in more sophisticated

methodological approaches and as more

and more quote/unquote big data or

publicly available data sets are

available sociologists are shifting the

focus of some of the questions they ask

while still maintaining that long

tradition of a more micro level analysis

and simultaneously we know there are

many public political and funding

threats to the credibility and

legitimacy of the social sciences

they're occurring right now and so at

the same time that sociology may be

expanding in its focus it's also more

and more being expected to defend those

blurry boundaries that oftentimes make

up our very discipline and so with that

I think we're definitely at time and

thank you for listening

you


hey guys it's Lex again and you're

watching Titanic all around the world

there are some amazing fun quirky creepy

downright freaky traditions that have

been followed for sometimes hundreds

about thousands of years

today we join in on the fun and take

part in some amazing traditions from

around the world

number 28 be a guitar hero don't deny it

that's right fess up we've all done it

right it seems to be a natural instinct

for young kids when listening to their

favorite rock ballad the air guitar if

you still fancy yourself as a hot air

guitarist sign up for the annual world

championships in Finland yes the

generally conservative Finns own this

one and they take it seriously

number 27 excellent every spring in

Bosnia everyone gets to eat a whole lot

of eggs at an egg festival it has become

quite the tourist attraction with many

visitors participating so much so that

one would think they don't have eggs in

their homeland truth is nobody there is

strangely crazy about eggs but it is a

fun tradition and eggs of course are a

symbol of birth and new beginnings

number 26 a delicate time now close to

Poland they toss large handmade straw

dolls into the rivers to mark winters

end it sounds more like scarecrows to us

but maybe that's a matter of opinion

one man's doll is another man's

scarecrow we guess the dolls are made up

nicely and paraded through the town

before being tossed into the water

number 25 bring your jolly Brawley we're

still in Poland make sure you have an

umbrella handy on Easter Monday or even

a wetsuit by the sound of things because

if you're there on wet Monday you're

bound to get soaked the plan is to

drench whomever you can with water hoses

water balloons or any means possible

number 24 keeping your nose clean how

many times has your mom told you to stop

slurping your soup in many Eastern

countries to slurp is good manners as it

shows appreciation told you mom however

be very careful when blowing your nose

in Japan quietly and discreetly is the

order of the day here even better don't

toot your sniffer in front of anyone if

it can be helped it must be stressful to

have a cold over there number 23 spicy

singles remember the time you're in

Denmark and you were pelted with

cinnamon sticks it's a good thing is it

when she were single and more

importantly under 30 those were the good

old

be less pleased if you find yourself

dodging peppercorns as then you are not

only single but clearly over thirty

number 22 murder on the dance floor

the festival FOMA dahana in madagascar

involves paying homage to the deceased

in one's family it's not an annual event

but rather occurs once every few years

probably because it can be super

expensive families host lavish dinners

and donate clothes and new items for

bereaved families and for those

underground they also dance the deceased

in order to show respect but not

literally of course that would be

horrifying crying is frowned upon as it

is a joyous occasion so a stiff upper

lip may be required for something we see

a Madagascar v movie in wings here

number 21 reflection on the new year in

Bali the new year is seen in with a day

of silence and meditation on yuppie

there will be no bonfires or barbecues

work or travel and obviously sure and

entertainment even talking must be kept

to a minimum the only people to be seen

in the streets are security personnel to

ensure all is in order look elsewhere if

you're looking to travel for a New

Year's bash then Ibiza may be a little

more upbeat than we've heard number 26

feet under the Danes have a very

practical view of cemeteries and use

them as places of leisure as we would

parks and other open spaces cemeteries

there are nice and neatly kept so why

not and we're sure most would agree that

perusing through old tombstones can

actually be interesting thus on any

given sunny weekend and assistance

Kierkegaard in Copenhagen for example

one will see friends and families

What’s up with society, exactly?

I mean, is it a smoothly functioning whole, with
different parts that fit together to keep it ticking?

Or is it a jumble of different, competing
groups, constantly at each other’s throats,
struggling for control?

Or maybe it's, you know, a bunch of people
who are just trying to get through their days.

The fact is, there isn't one answer to the question
of what the nature of society really is.

But all three of the models that I just described

– society as a well-oiled machine, as a group
of competing interests, and as bunch of people
just interacting with each other –

they’re all worth considering.

Because they each offer their own perspectives
on the social world, and they’re each crucial to
understanding the practice of sociology,

with histories that can be traced back to
a founding figure in the discipline.

So, let’s talk about paradigms.

[Theme Music]

A paradigm is not some kind of high-tech parachute.

And it doesn’t equal twenty cents.

Instead, a paradigm is basically a model for
how you think about things –

a set of concepts and theories that frames your
perspective on a certain topic, whether it’s Russian
literature or public art or the laws of physics.

And in sociology, theoretical paradigms are
key.

These paradigms are the fundamental assumptions
that sociologists have about the social world,

the ones that guide their thinking and research.

And that might sound kind of prejudicial at first,
like you’re going into the study of society with
certain biases in mind.

But you need the assumptions that these paradigms
provide, because raw facts don't interpret themselves.

Raw facts are things like "the unemployment
rate last year was 5%," or "Sam is six feet tall," or

"today a group of people with signs
blocked the highway."

By raw I mean that these facts are just simple
descriptions of empirical reality.

And they don’t come pre-interpreted.

Is 5% an acceptable unemployment rate?

Or should we be trying to lower it?

Is six feet tall actually tall?

And are protesters who are blocking a
highway disrupting the order of society, or are
they struggling for their interests?

The answer to that last one is, of course,
both.

But the important thing to understand is that
either answer requires you to make some assumptions
about the social world.

The other important thing is that those two
different answers will be useful in different situations,
for answering different kinds of questions.

For instance, if you're trying to understand
how and why society can hold together at all,

then looking at protests as signs of strain
or disruption might be more useful.

But if you're trying to understand why people
protest, then trying to understand how they're
pursuing their interests might be better.

Now, all this might sound kind of unscientific:
Physics doesn't need "interpretation" exactly.

Math doesn't need multiple "perspectives."

But actually, they do.

All scientific disciplines make assumptions about
the world, and all scientific disciplines use different
perspectives, depending on the questions they’re asking.

In physics, you can understand a bouncing ball
as a nearly uncountable multitude of fundamental
particles, each with its own wave function,

and all held together by different kinds
of forces at the quantum scale.

Or you can just understand it as simply X
number of grams of rubber moving through space.

The perspective you take will dramatically
change what kinds of questions you want to ask.

All sciences ask different kinds of questions and
have different assumptions for answering them.

And raw facts always need some kind of
perspective in order to make them useful.

Now, if we want to talk about different kinds
of questions and perspectives in sociology,

a good place to start is with something we
brought up last episode:

the fact that sociology looks at society at
all levels, at all scales, from the huge to the tiny.

In other words, sociology is concerned with
both the macro and the micro.

An orientation towards the macro means looking
at the big.

When sociologists ask questions at this level,
they're taking a broad focus, looking at the
large-scale structures that shape society.

Macro questions are things like "What caused
the transition from feudalism to capitalism?"

or "How does race impact educational achievement?"

An orientation toward the micro, of course,
means looking at the small.

These questions are concerned more narrowly with
interactions between individuals, asking things like:

"Do doctors talk to patients of different
races differently?"

or "How do the members of a certain group
build a group identity?"

Now, it's worth noting that these orientations
aren't completely separate.

Because, again, the big and the small are
always connected.

Asking how doctors talk to patients of different
races is a micro question, but it also helps

us begin to understand the macro-level pattern
of racial disparities in healthcare.

Likewise, asking about how a group builds
its identity could have macro impacts,

because it could help explain how large social
structures are reproduced and maintained.

Now that we understand a little more about
the different scales that sociology works on,

we can turn to its main theoretical paradigms,
of which there are three:

There’s structural functionalism, conflict
theory, and symbolic interactionism.

Let’s start with structural functionalism,
which originated with a French sociologist
named Emile Durkheim.

Durkheim imagined society as a kind of organism,
with different parts that all worked together to
keep it alive and in good health.

Of course, things could go wrong.

But this was always imagined by Durkheim
as a malfunction, an illness, or a deviation from
the normal functioning of things.

So the structural functionalist perspective
makes this same basic assumption:

Society is seen as a complex system whose parts
work together to promote stability and social order.

And these different “parts" of society are social
structures, relatively stable patterns of social behavior.

For example, Durkheim was extremely interested
in religion, and also in the division of labor,

or how tasks in a society are divided up.

And these structures are seen as fulfilling
certain social functions.

For instance, the family, in most societies,
fulfills the function of socializing children –
teaching them how to live in that society.

And social functions come in two types: manifest
and latent functions.

Manifest functions are intended or obvious
consequences of a particular structure, while latent
functions are unintended or unrecognized.

For example, we often think of the purpose
of schools as providing children with knowledge
– that’s their manifest function.

But, schools can also help socialize children.

They can have – and historically have had
– the additional purpose of creating workers
who listen to authority and hit deadlines.

That’s a latent function.

Now, along with functions, we also have social
dysfunction, which is any social pattern that
disrupts the smooth operation of society.

Technological development is a powerful driver
of economic improvement, for example, which
is a useful function.

But it’s also a destabilizing force.

New machines can put people out of work.

Someday soon, we may see the social dysfunction
of thousands of long distance truckers being
displaced by self-driving vehicles.

And this brings us to one of the problems
with structural functionalism.

Since it sees society as fundamentally functional
and stable, it can be really bad at dealing with change.

It can be bad at providing good
explanations for why change happens,

and it can also interpret bad things in
society as having positive functions, which should
therefore not be changed.

To take an extreme example, a structural
functionalist view might imagine that poverty,

although harmful to people, is functional
for society, because it ensures there are always
people who want work.

So this view might see any attempts at alleviating
poverty as being potentially damaging to society.

It’s in areas like this, however, where
conflict theories shine.

In contrast to structural functionalism, conflict theories imagine society as being composed of different groups that struggle over scarce resources – like power, money, land, food, or status.

This view takes change as being fundamental
to society, constantly driven by these conflicts.

The first conflict theory in sociology was
the theory of class conflict, advanced by Karl Marx.

This theory imagines society as having different
classes based on their relationships to the means of
production – things like factories and raw materials.

Under capitalism, the two classes were the capitalists, or bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the workers, or proletariat, who must sell their labor to survive.

Marx saw this conflict between classes as
the central conflict in society and the source
of social inequality in power and wealth.

But there are other conflict theories that
focus on different kinds of groups.

Race-Conflict theory, for example, was first
stated sociologically by W.E.B. DuBois, another
founder of sociology.

It understands social inequality as the result of
conflict between different racial and ethnic groups.

Gender-Conflict theory, meanwhile, focuses on
the social inequalities between women and men.

The perspective of all three kinds of conflict
theory have been crucially important in American
history and are still important today.

But the paradigms we've looked at so far are
essentially macro approaches:

Structural functionalism focuses on how large
structures fit together, and conflict theory looks at how
society defines sources of inequality and conflict.

But then there’s symbolic interactionism,
and it’s built to deal with micro questions.

Symbolic interactionism first appeared most
clearly in the work of German sociologist Max Weber
and his focus on Verstehen, or "understanding."

Weber believed that sociology needed to
focus on people’s individual social situations and
the meaning that they attached to them.

So, because it’s more micro-focused, symbolic
interactionism understands society as the
product of everyday social interactions.

Specifically, this school of thought is interested
in understanding the shared reality that people
create through their interactions.

It might seem weird to say that reality can
be created, but think back to the idea of
raw facts versus interpretation.

Waving my my hand back and forth is a raw fact,
but it only means that I'm waving hello to you because
we’ve agreed to give it that meaning.

For symbolic interactionism, then, there is
no big-T truth.

Instead, it looks at the world that we create when
we assign meaning to interactions and objects.

A handshake is only a greeting because we
agree that it is.

A dog can be a friend or food, depending on
what meaning we've given it.

Obviously, these three different paradigms provide
radically different ways of looking at the social world.

But, this is because they all grasp at different
parts of it.

They each give us a different lens through we can see
our social lives, just like science sometimes needs a
microscope and sometimes needs a telescope.

All of these lenses are important and, yes,
necessary for the investigation of sociological
questions.

Today we discussed what theoretical paradigms
are, and talked more in depth about the macro/micro
distinction.

Then we took a look at the three major
paradigms in sociology, and learned a bit about
their advantages and disadvantages.

Next week we're going to start learning how
these paradigms can be used to do actual
sociological research.

Have you ever met a friend’s parents and
realized that your friend was basically a
mini-me of their mom?

Not just because they both have brown hair
or a pointy nose.

It’s how they talk, the way they both like
making silly puns, their attitudes and beliefs.

Now the question is: How much of that
similarity is genetic,

and how much is just a function of that fact that your
friend grew up with their mom, and pretty much learned
how to be a human being by watching her?

This is the age old question: nature or nurture?

Nature is the part of human behavior that’s
biologically determined and instinctive.

When a baby latches onto your finger and won’t
let go, and it’s basically the cutest thing

in the whole world, it’s not because they
learned to do that – it’s natural.

A lot of human behavior, however, isn’t
instinctive – it comes instead from how
you’re nurtured.

The nurture part of behavior is based on the
people and environment you’re raised in.

And it’s this second part – the social
environment that determines human behavior

– that sociologists tend to investigate
and have many different theories about.

[Theme Music]

To a big extent, we develop our personalities
and learn about our society and culture through a
social process – one known as socialization.

Sounds legit, right?

But what happens if you don’t have people
around you?

Social isolation affects our emotional and
cognitive development, a lot.

To get a glimpse into how and why this is, let’s
go to the Thought Bubble to look at sociologist
Kingsley Davis’s case studies on Anna.

In the winter of 1938, a social worker investigated a
report of child neglect on a small Pennsylvania farm and
found, hidden in a storage shed, a five-year-old girl.

That five-year girl was Anna.

She was unwanted by the family she was born into and was passed from house to house among neighbors and strangers for the first six months of her life.

Eventually, she ended up being kept in a shed
with no human contact other than to receive food.

Kingsley Davis observed Anna for years after
her rescue and wrote about the effects of this
upbringing on her development.

When Anna was first rescued, she was unable
to speak or smile, and was completely unresponsive
to human interaction.

Even after years of education and medical
attention, her mental development at age eight
was less than that of a typical two-year old.

This is a story with both a sad beginning
and a sad ending.

Anna died of a blood disorder at the age of
10.

And Davis’ study of how isolation affects
young children was only one of many that have
shown how a lack of socialization affects
children’s ability to develop language skills,
social skills, and emotional stability.

Thanks Thought Bubble.

There are lots of different theories about
how we develop personalities, cognitive skills,

and moral behavior, many of which come from
our siblings in social science: psychologists.

Take Sigmund Freud.

You’ve heard of him: Austrian guy?

Liked cigars?
Invented the field of psychoanalysis?

One of his main theories was about how personalities
develop.

He thought we were born with something called
an id.

You can think of the id as your most basic,
unconscious drive – a desire for food, comfort,
attention.

All a baby knows is it wants THAT and it will
scream until it gets it.

But then we develop the ego and superego to
balance the id.

Ego is the voice of reason, your conscious
efforts to rein in the pleasure-seeking id.

And your superego is made up of the cultural
values and norms that you internalize and
use to guide your decisions.

So if the id is the devil on your shoulder,
the superego is the angel on the other shoulder,

and the ego is the mediator who intervenes
when the angel and devil start fighting.

Now, a lot of Freud’s work hasn’t stood
the test of time,

but his theories about how society affects our
development has influenced pretty much everyone
who has researched the human personality.

This includes Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget,
who spent much of his career in the early
1900s studying cognitive development.

While researching ways to measure children’s
intelligence, Piaget noticed that kids of similar
ages tended to make similar mistakes.

And this, to Piaget, suggested that there
were four different stages of cognitive development.

First Stage: TOUCH EVERYTHING!

Babies learn about the world by grabbing things
and sticking them in their mouths.

This curious, slobbery interaction with the world
is what Piaget called the sensorimotor stage –

the level of development where all knowledge
is based on what you can perceive with your senses.

Around age 2, a child enters the next stage,
known as the preoperational stage.

At this point, kids have learned to use language
and begin to ask questions to learn about
the world, rather than just grabbing stuff.

Now they can think about the world and
use their imaginations – which leads to playing
pretend and an understanding of symbols.

But thinking about the world is pretty much
limited to how THEY think about the world.

Kids in the preoperational stage are pretty
ego-centric;

if they love playing with trains and you ask them
what their dad’s favorite thing to do is, they’ll probably
say that he loves playing with trains too.

It’s not until they reach the concrete operational
stage, around 6 or 7, that they develop the

ability to take in other people’s perspectives,
and begin to make cause-and-effect connections
between events in their surroundings.

And in the formal operational stage, at about
age 12, Piaget said, kids begin to think in
the abstract and use logic and critical thinking.

Now, American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg later
expanded on Piaget’s model of cognitive development
to incorporate stages of moral development.

Essentially, kids’ sense of what is “right” begins
in what Kohlberg called the pre-conventional stage,

where right is just what feels good
to them personally.

Next, they move to the conventional stage,
where what’s right is what society and the
people around them tells them is right.

And then finally, children end up in the post-conventional
stage, where they begin to consider more abstract
ethical concepts than just right or wrong.

So at a young age, a child doesn’t realize
that grabbing the candy bar they want at the
store is wrong – they just want it.

But then, a combination of societal norms
and being scolded by their parents convinces
them that stealing is wrong, no matter how
much they want the candy bar.

And over time, they learn that morals have
gray areas;

stealing is wrong if it’s just for fun, but
might be considered less wrong if you’re 
stealing to feed your family.

Eventually, children reach a point where they’re
able to think about things like freedom and justice,

and realize that societal norms about
what’s right may not always line up with
these principles.

Sure, laws against stealing candy may be just,
but what about laws that say only certain
people can get married?

Just because something is a law, is it right?

How you feel about that question may depend
on your socialization.

And on your gender.

Carol Gilligan, an American psychologist who
started out as a research assistant and collaborator

of Kohlberg’s, explored how girls and boys
experience these stages differently.

She realized that Kohlberg’s original studies
only had male subjects – which may have biased
his findings.

When she expanded the research to look at
both male and female children, she found that

boys tended to emphasize formal rules to define
right and wrong – what she called a justice
perspective.

Whereas girls tended to emphasize the role
of interpersonal reasoning in moral decisions

– what she called a care and responsibility
perspective.

Gilligan argued that these differences stem
from cultural conditioning that girls receive
to fulfill ideals of femininity.

She thought that we socialize girls to be
more nurturing and empathetic, and that influences
their moral interpretation of behavior.

The next theory of social development I want
to focus on is from American sociologist George

Herbert Mead, who was one of the founders
of the sociological paradigm we talked about

a few episodes ago, known as symbolic interactionism.

His work focused on how we develop a “self.”

What makes up the you that is inherently you?

Are you born with some inherent spark of you-ness?

According to Mead no!

Instead, he believed that we figure out who
we are through other people.

All social interactions require you to see
yourself as someone else might see you –

something Mead described as “taking on 
the role of others.”

In the first stage of development, according
to Mead’s model, we learn through imitation

– we watch how others behave and try to
behave like them.

You see your mom smile at your neighbor, so
you smile too.

And Mead observed that as kids got older,
they moved on to a new stage – play.

Rather than just imitating your mom, you might
play at being a mom, taking care of a doll.

Assuming the role of “mommy” or “daddy”
is a kid imagining the world from their parent’s
perspective.

The next stage of development is the game
stage, where children learn to take on multiple
roles in a single situation.

What does that have to do with games?

Well, games use rules and norms, and require
kids to take on a role themselves, and develop
that role in reaction to the roles that others take on.

Team sports are a great example of this.

When you’re playing soccer, you need to not only
know what you’re going to do, but also what your
teammates and your opponents will do.

If you were ever the kid who ended up running
the wrong way on the soccer field because

you didn’t realize the ball had switched
possession, you know how important it is to
anticipate what other people do.

The last stage, in Mead’s model, occurs
when we learn how to take on multiple roles
in multiple situations.

In this phase, we weigh our self and our
actions not against one specific role, but against
a ‘generalized other’ –

basically, a manifestation of all of our
culture’s norms and expectations.

Now, you might have noticed that all these
theories focus on childhood.

So, does that mean that your personality is
set once you hit 18?

No, definitely no.

As anyone over 18 will tell you, you keep
growing well past high school.

And that’s why yet another theorist, German-born
psychologist Erik Erikson, came up with his

own eight-stage theory of development, that
goes all the way from infancy to old age.

He based these stages on the key challenge
of each period of life.

When you’re a toddler, for example, your
biggest challenge is getting what you want

– or as Erikson puts it, gaining autonomy,
which helps you build skills and confidence
in your abilities.

But once you’re a young adult, you’ve
got plenty of autonomy.

Now a bigger challenge is developing intimate
relationships.

Falling in love, finding friends – there’s a reason
that’s the focus of every 20-something sitcom.

And his list goes on.

Every life stage from when you’re born to when
you die features different expectations that inform
what we see as markers of social development.

Moving out, getting married, having kids – they’re
all societal markers of social development as an adult.

But whether you feel like one or not, adulthood
will come for us all –

and it’s your socialization that will determine
how exactly you perform the role of “adult.”

Next week, we’ll talk about the different
agents of socialization that shape who we
really end up being.

Today we learned about social development,
starting with the role of nature and nurture
in influencing a person’s development.

We talked about social isolation and the importance
of care and human interaction in early years
for proper emotional and mental development.

Then, we talked about five theories of development:
Freud’s Id, Ego, and Superego;

Piaget’s Four Stages of Cognitive Development,

Kohlberg and Gilligan’s theories of moral
development;

Mead’s theory of self;
And Erik Erikson’s life stage theory.

now, have in common with a toddler who’s
being read a bedtime story?

I’ll give you a clue.

It’s also something you have in common with
the kids in The Breakfast Club.

As well as with a soldier going through boot
camp.

Give up?

You’re all being socialized.

It’s also the title of the episode.

You probably saw that.

Each of us is surrounded by people, and those
people become a part of how we act and what
we value.

This is known as socialization: the social process
through which we develop our personalities and human
potential and learn about our society and culture.

Last time, we talked about the HOW of socialization,
how we learn about the social world.

And no matter which of the many theories out there
that you like best, the answer seems to be that we’re
socialized by interacting with other people.

But which people?

What we didn’t talk about last week was
the WHO of socialization:

Who do we learn about the social world from?

What people, and what institutions, have made
you who you are today?

[Theme Music]

Socialization is a life-long process, and
it begins in our families.

Mom, Dad, grandparents, siblings – whoever
you’re living with is pretty much your entire
social world when you’re very young.

And that’s important, because your family is the
source of what’s known as primary socialization –

your first experiences with language, values,
beliefs, behaviors, and norms of your society.

Parents and guardians are your first
teachers of everything –

from the small stuff like how to brush your teeth to
the big stuff like sex, religion, the law, and politics.

The games they play with you, the books they read, the toys they buy for you, all provide you with what French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu called cultural capital –

the non-financial assets that help people
succeed in the world.

Some of this cultural capital may seem fairly
innocuous – I mean, is reading Goodnight Moon
really making that big of an impact on a toddler?

Yes, actually.

It teaches the “value” of reading as much
as it helps the child begin to recognize written
language.

The presence of books in the home is associated
with children doing well in school.

Another important form of socialization that
starts in the home is gender socialization,

learning the psychological and social traits
associated with a person’s sex.

Gender socialization starts from the moment
that parents decide on a gendered name and when
nurses put a pink or a blue hat on the baby.

Other group memberships, like race and class,
are important parts of initial socialization.

Race socialization is the process through
which children learn the behaviors, values,
and attitudes associated with racial groups.

Racial discrimination is partly the result
of what parents teach their children about
members of other races.

And class socialization teaches the norms,
values, traits, and behaviors you develop
based on the social class you’re in.

This may help explain why more middle- and
upper-class children go to college.

Not only can the families afford to send them,
but these children are expected to attend.

They grow up in a home that normalizes college
attendance.

Now, gender, race, and class socialization
are all examples of anticipatory socialization

– that’s the social process where people
learn to take on the values and standards
of groups that they plan to join .

Small children anticipate becoming adults,
for example, and they learn to play the part
by watching their parents.

Gender socialization teaches boys to “be
a man” and girls to “be a woman”.

But children also learn through secondary
socialization –

that’s the process through which children
become socialized outside the home, within
society at large.

This often starts with school.

Schools are often kids’ first introduction
to things like bureaucracies,

as well as systems of rules that require them to be
in certain places at certain times, or act in ways that
may be different from what they learned at home.

Not only do schools teach us the three r’s
– reading, ‘riting and ‘rithmetic –

but they come with what sociologists call a hidden
curriculum – that is, an education in norms, values,
and beliefs that are passed along through schooling.

Take, for example, a spelling bee.

Its main goal is to teach literacy and encourage
kids to learn how to spell.

But something as seemingly benign as a spelling
bee can have many hidden lessons that stick
with kids, too.

For example, it teaches them that doing better
than their peers is rewarding – and it enforces
the idea that the world has winners and losers.

Another hidden curriculum of school in general
is to expose kids to a variety of people.

When your only socialization is your family,
you just get one perspective on race, class,
religion, politics, et cetera.

But once you go out into the world, you meet
many people from many backgrounds,

teaching you about race and ethnicity, social class,
disability, gender and sexuality, and more.

School becomes not just a classroom for
academic subjects, but also for learning
about different kinds of people.

And, of course, schools are also where kids
are exposed to one of the most defining aspects
of school-age life: peer groups.

Peer groups are social groups whose members
have interests, social position, and usually
age in common.

As you get older, your peer group has a massive
impact on the socialization process.

Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to to see
just how big that impact can be.

In the late 1950s, American sociologist James
Coleman began studying teenagers –

how they interacted and how their social
lives affected their education.

He interviewed teens in 11 high schools in the Midwest, asking them questions about what social group they identified with and who else they considered members of their group.

Based on these interviews, Coleman identified
four main social categories.

And, uh, the names of these categories will
probably sound familiar to you:

They were nerds, jocks, leading crowd, and burnouts.

Basically, he discovered the 1950s version
of The Breakfast Club.

And with these social categories came social
prescriptions – behaviors that were expected
of people in those groups.

Coleman found that certain things were important to
the members of certain groups, like being a good dancer
or smoking or having money or getting good grades.

He also tested the students’ IQs and assessed
their grades.

And surprise!

It turned out that who you hung out with affected
how well you did in school.

In some of the schools, getting good grades was considered an important criterion for the “leading group” – aka the popular kids– but in other schools, it wasn’t.

And in the schools where good grades
were not a sign of popularity,

students who scored high on IQ tests actually did
worse on their exams than similarly smart students
at schools where good grades made you popular.

Thanks Thought Bubble!

Now, Coleman’s study might seem like common
sense – of course you and your friends are
gonna be pretty similar.

Don’t we choose to be friends with people
who are like us?

Well, not entirely.

Coleman’s study showed that we don’t just
pick peer groups that fit into our existing traits –

instead, peer groups help mold
what traits we end up with.

OK, so far, we have family, schools, and peers
as the main forces that influence someone’s
socialization.

But what about me?

Yes, me, Nicole Sweeney.

Am I part of your socialization?

Or more precisely, are youtube videos considered
a form of socialization?

Short answer: yes!

Long answer: The media you consume are
absolutely a part of your socialization.

TV and the internet are huge parts of Americans’
lives.

And how we consume our media is affected by
social traits, like class, race, and age.

A teenager or twenty-something in 2017 is
much more likely to watch online media, like
Netflix or youtube, than television.

And low-income Americans watch much more TV
than their higher-income counterparts.

The media we consume also impact us dramatically.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example,
has said there are connections between excessive

television viewing in early childhood and
cognitive, language and social emotional delays.

But TV can also influence the attitudes of
viewers, especially young ones.

For example, studies have found that kids exposed to Sesame Street in randomized-controlled trial settings, reported more positive attitudes toward people of different races –

most likely a result of the program’s wide variety of characters from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.

TV also affects us well beyond childhood.

One recent study found that MTV’s “16 and
Pregnant” may have acted as a cautionary tale,

helping to change teen girls’ attitudes toward
birth control and contributing to declining rates
of teen pregnancy.

So far, the types of socialization we’ve
talked about have been fairly subtle — but there are
also more intense types of socialization.

Total institutions are places where people
are completely cut off from the outside world,
and face strict rules for how they must behave.

First coined by sociologist Erving Goffman, the term “total institution” refers to places like the military, prisons, boarding schools, or psychiatric institutions that control all aspects of their residents’ lives –

how they dress, how they speak,
where they eat, where they sleep.

And in a total institution, residents undergo resocialization, where their environment is carefully controlled to encourage them to develop a new set of norms, values, or beliefs.

They do this by, basically, breaking down
your existing identity and then using rewards
and punishment to build up a whole new you.

Think about every boot camp movie you’ve
ever seen.

All soldiers are given the same haircut and uniform, expected to reply to questions in the same way, put through the same grueling exercises, and humiliated by the same officer.

This process re-socializes the soldiers to put extreme value on their identity within the group, making them more willing to value self-sacrifice if their unit is in danger.

So whether you’re GI Jane training for a reconnaissance team or Molly Ringwald trying to maintain her queen-bee status in the leading crowd,

the you that you are has been powerfully
shaped by people and institutions.

Now, think back on your own life – who has
been the biggest influence on YOUR socialization?

Who do you think that you yourself have influenced?

Hard questions to answer, maybe, but definitely
worthwhile – and hopefully a little easier now that
you’ve learned how sociologists think about it.

Today, we learned about five different types
of socialization.

We talked about anticipatory socialization
from your family, like gender norms, that
prepare children for entering society.

We discussed the “hidden curriculum” in
schools.

We learned about peer groups through a look
at James Coleman’s study of teenage social
groups.

We explored the role of media in socialization.

And finally, we talked about total institutions
and how they can act as a form of re-socialization.
