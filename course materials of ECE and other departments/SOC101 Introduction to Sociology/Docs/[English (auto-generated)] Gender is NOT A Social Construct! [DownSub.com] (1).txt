so by now I'm sure you've heard that

gender is a social construct it's a

common argument used by feminists sjw's

and by otherwise intelligent people

gender is not a social construct it's

biological and that's just an objective

truth however I do concede that certain

aspects of gender are socially

constructed think of boys wear blue and

girls wear pink there's nothing in our

biology that leads us to this behavior

but it's important to differentiate

between expectations of gender and

gender itself you don't get to say that

gender itself is socially constructed

just because certain aspects of the

expectations of gender are socially

constructed it's very interesting to me

how the same people who will say that

gender is a social construct will be the

same people that argue for

transgenderism and who say that trans

identities are legitimate and obviously

I think they are legitimate but when you

say something like generators are social

constructs what you're basically saying

is that trans people are just the

performance of gender that they're just

behaving like the opposite gender for

shits and giggles rather than how their

biology is fueling them to behave

personally I see myself as irrefutable

living breathing proof that gender is

not a social constructs I had the social

constructive placed on me from the

moment I was born in the hospital and

wrapped up in a blue blanket rather than

a pink one but if it was a social

contract than I should by all means

identify and in my life as a man but

clearly that didn't work out so let's

just look at some really basic science

to debunk this feminist argument so male

brains are about ten percent larger than

female brains and no that's not an

indicator that men are smarter men also

have about 7% more gray matter in the

brain and women have about 10% more

white matter in the cerebellum men have

more connections between hemispheres

which means an increased ability to

translate perception into motor skill

and ability recognizing a threat and

acting on it throughout evolution males

have to perform greater physical feats

to defend the females and the children

of the tribe ensuring the survivability

of its bloodline in other words men are

more aggressive

so when feminists say you know that we

teach men to be aggressive and to be

brutes and to go out there and be

dominant

that's not

Chuchu that's in their blood in contrast

women have more connections across the

frontal lobes which translates to an

increased empathy social skills and

nurturing behaviors these are essential

to raising children which women are

wired for so in feminists say that the

set up of men to go and work and women

to have to stay home with the kids is

because men want to exercise their

dominance and patriarchal control it's

just false

that's our biology that's how millions

of years of evolution have mapped out

our survival as a species and you can

make the argument that you know we're

more than just animals and this isn't as

necessary but you know at the end of the

day we are just animals and we're driven

by our biology we can definitely

overcome that but pretending as if it's

some sort of social construct in which

men are exerting their power over women

is just conspiratorial next we have to

look at hormones which absolutely

dictate certain behaviors and

inclinations of the genders higher

testosterone in the body which males

have fuel behaviors such as

competitiveness higher sex drive more

aggression and providing resources to

attract potential mates these behaviors

make total sense when you take into

account our evolutionary needs and

psychology women who have more estrogen

have the instinct to nurture empathize

and make themselves physically

attractive for potential mates think of

why women by and large choose majors and

college that involve helping others

psychology child development sociology

this is a direct result of their

instinct to nurture and help others not

a social construct impressing them and

telling them they can't do anything else

think of why there's a billion dollar

beauty industry women whether they admit

it or not are different by an instinct

to be attractive to the opposite sex

this isn't a social contract telling

women they must be beautiful in the wild

being attractive to the opposite sex

means ensuring resources think of why

there are male cops firefighters and

other men to support Lee in hero roles

men have an instinct and desire to

protect especially women and children so

there are exceptions to the rules

obviously feminine men masculine women

trans people these are all exceptions to

the rules they're outliers they're

anomalies and some may say that they

have

genetic defect but exceptions do not

disprove a generality so when it comes

down to it almost every behavior that we

had tribute with maleness or femaleness

boils down to biology and evolution

society has certainly as a result came

to expect these gender specific

attributes and behaviors but they didn't

pop out of nowhere other means to

impress people who don't fit into a

rigid gender role you don't get to

change the definition of words to suit

your narrative bye guys
