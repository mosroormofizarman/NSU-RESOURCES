hey guys it's Lex again and you're

watching Titanic all around the world

there are some amazing fun quirky creepy

downright freaky traditions that have

been followed for sometimes hundreds

about thousands of years

today we join in on the fun and take

part in some amazing traditions from

around the world

number 28 be a guitar hero don't deny it

that's right fess up we've all done it

right it seems to be a natural instinct

for young kids when listening to their

favorite rock ballad the air guitar if

you still fancy yourself as a hot air

guitarist sign up for the annual world

championships in Finland yes the

generally conservative Finns own this

one and they take it seriously

number 27 excellent every spring in

Bosnia everyone gets to eat a whole lot

of eggs at an egg festival it has become

quite the tourist attraction with many

visitors participating so much so that

one would think they don't have eggs in

their homeland truth is nobody there is

strangely crazy about eggs but it is a

fun tradition and eggs of course are a

symbol of birth and new beginnings

number 26 a delicate time now close to

Poland they toss large handmade straw

dolls into the rivers to mark winters

end it sounds more like scarecrows to us

but maybe that's a matter of opinion

one man's doll is another man's

scarecrow we guess the dolls are made up

nicely and paraded through the town

before being tossed into the water

number 25 bring your jolly Brawley we're

still in Poland make sure you have an

umbrella handy on Easter Monday or even

a wetsuit by the sound of things because

if you're there on wet Monday you're

bound to get soaked the plan is to

drench whomever you can with water hoses

water balloons or any means possible

number 24 keeping your nose clean how

many times has your mom told you to stop

slurping your soup in many Eastern

countries to slurp is good manners as it

shows appreciation told you mom however

be very careful when blowing your nose

in Japan quietly and discreetly is the

order of the day here even better don't

toot your sniffer in front of anyone if

it can be helped it must be stressful to

have a cold over there number 23 spicy

singles remember the time you're in

Denmark and you were pelted with

cinnamon sticks it's a good thing is it

when she were single and more

importantly under 30 those were the good

old

be less pleased if you find yourself

dodging peppercorns as then you are not

only single but clearly over thirty

number 22 murder on the dance floor

the festival FOMA dahana in madagascar

involves paying homage to the deceased

in one's family it's not an annual event

but rather occurs once every few years

probably because it can be super

expensive families host lavish dinners

and donate clothes and new items for

bereaved families and for those

underground they also dance the deceased

in order to show respect but not

literally of course that would be

horrifying crying is frowned upon as it

is a joyous occasion so a stiff upper

lip may be required for something we see

a Madagascar v movie in wings here

number 21 reflection on the new year in

Bali the new year is seen in with a day

of silence and meditation on yuppie

there will be no bonfires or barbecues

work or travel and obviously sure and

entertainment even talking must be kept

to a minimum the only people to be seen

in the streets are security personnel to

ensure all is in order look elsewhere if

you're looking to travel for a New

Year's bash then Ibiza may be a little

more upbeat than we've heard number 26

feet under the Danes have a very

practical view of cemeteries and use

them as places of leisure as we would

parks and other open spaces cemeteries

there are nice and neatly kept so why

not and we're sure most would agree that

perusing through old tombstones can

actually be interesting thus on any

given sunny weekend and assistance

Kierkegaard in Copenhagen for example

one will see friends and families

enjoying a picnic walking around or

simply hanging out for fun number 19

it's no joke in Switzerland a snowman is

burnt at the stake to signal the

beginning of spring well not a real

snowman is that would totally flat the

laws of thermodynamics or rather an

effigy of one known as the Boog the

burning of this iconic Powell made from

snow dates back to these 16th centuries

to add a bit of fizz exclusives are

often stuffed inside now we're talking

number 18 well done for me please

in Brazil the yanomam√∂ tribe eats their

loved ones after passing but fortunately

not in a court escort cannibalistic way

the remains are cremated and some of the

ash is added to a special dish prepared

in the deceased sonner

so that's so bad after all number 17

for thought every January 25th in the

land of the Thistle residents enjoy

Burns Night Robert Burns was a

celebrated Scottish author and poet

venerated for his contribution to local

culture the traditional dish of haggis

is prepared consisting of sheep entrails

cooked in the stomach casing and some of

mr. Burns's work is read out loud number

16 showing your opponent the finger

finger wrestling in the Alps

particularly in Switzerland has

traditionally been a method for

resolving disputes now it's a big sport

step one

stare your opponent down from the

opposite side of the table step two

select your preferred digit step three

lock fingers step four hold your weaker

opponent on and over to your side of the

table and step five bask in glory how

does one become a finger wrestling

champion many one figured pull-ups and

tennis ball squeezing perhaps number 15

Rumpy granny de March first in Bulgaria

is Baba Mar today meaning the

grandmother of March but this granny is

no pushover she's somewhat ill-tempered

and needs to be appreciated and treated

very nicely otherwise she will delay the

oncoming summer not cool grandma to

celebrate and show the dear old lady

they are toeing the line

Bulgarians wear white and red bracelets

friends and family hand the trinkets out

to one another as a token of peace and

prosperity

number 14 happy landings if you've been

in an aircraft occupied by people from

Poland

you may have noticed the clapping and

all-around festive vibe when the plane

touches down safely

not really sure why this happens

hopefully flying in Poland isn't really

that scary number 13 a toothy smile in

rural Indonesia women sharpen their

teeth to achieve the Pointer look this

is done by sign filing for chiseling

women with carnivorous looking teeth are

regarded as extremely beautiful

fortunately it isn't compulsory but is

merely high-fashion take care with that

first kiss number 12

Braveheart there's an initiation custom

in Brazil that is not for the

faint-hearted young boys prove their

bravery by putting their hands in a

basket of angry bullet ants if you have

no idea what it feels like to be bitten

by a bullet ant let us give you a

blow-by-blow account by one dr. Justin

Schmidt it really felt like a bullet it

was instantaneous almost even before it

stung me it was absolutely riveting

there were huge waves and crescendos of

burning pain coming out of my thing

number 11 hold it in new married couples

in the Tea dong community in Indonesia

have a very strange vision that they may

not use the washroom for three days

after tying the knot if they do it will

bring bad luck to their marriage

reports suggest this even includes using

the room to answer the calls of nature

how they managed that feat we honestly

don't know number 10 the big three-o if

you're unmarried and are about to turn

the big three-o and living in Germany

chances are you'll find yourself

cleaning the doorknobs belonging to your

best friend if you want to get out of

this tedious chore grab a kiss from the

opposite gender quickly number 9 sweets

before my sweets

there are different variations of this

tradition around the world but in

Bolivia it's an annual must do and all

the pastry shops and bakeries are in on

it too they prepare all of their cakes

and desserts as per usual but in the odd

one here and there they'll hide a coin

whoever is lucky enough to find the coin

will have a new year filled with

goodness and wonderful surprises number

eight an eye for an eye or in this case

you're giving up a finger and it's a

tradition belonging to the Donny Orton

Donny tribe of people that live in Bali

and Valley in West Papua New Guinea they

have tradition of chopping their fingers

off to show that they are grieving they

also smear their faces with ashes and

clay to show how sorrowful they are the

amputated fingers get buried with their

deceased loved one as a symbol of their

eternal love don't you feel a little

sorry for the person who might have had

an affair number seven cry just a little

in China brides are said to cry for a

month before tying the knot with their

followed by the Fuji living in Wuling

mountains the crying is actually happy

crying and the whole female side of the

family joins in on it too but a

different stages before the bride's big

day number six what goes up toddler

tossing in India is something that has

been practiced for 700 years

apparently the custom is banned in India

blanket held out by friends and family

and is meant to bring good luck to the

falling child number 5 happy birthday to

all when it's a child's birthday in the

Bend is an old wedding tradition that

takes place in Germany all the friends

and family of the newlyweds come

together and break dishes which the

bride and groom then have to clean up it

said to assist them and practicing to

work together when times are tough

surely there must be other ways than

wasting plates though like try handing

them a newborn baby and leaving them

alone for a couple hours that'll do the

trick although the wedding may be called

off shortly thereafter

number three is sink or swim this is a

tradition that will not be around for

very much longer and it is called stilt

fishing it takes place in Sri Lanka and

it comes about when there was over

fishing near the shores so the men would

fish on top of the water they would use

capsized boats initially but then

developed this unique way of doing it

some reports suggest that those still

using this method are simply there to

lure the tourists to the area and

they're not actually catching fish

number two which which is which over in

the Czech Republic they have an annual

ritual before you freak out they don't

go looking for real witches they're just

celebrating the end of winter in the old

days they believed that witches got

weaker as the weather got warmer and it

became a tradition to make something

that looked like a witch and burn it at

the end of April it's very festive and

fun evening enjoyed by Minnie

number one Back to Black blackening the

bride takes place in Scotland and it's a

pre-wedding ritual which is way more fun

for the bride's friends than the bride

herself

the poor girl gets pelted with eggs sour

milk Rotten Tomatoes really anything

super disgusting goes she's then paraded

through town in all her disgusting glory

its metaphor for the tough life that she
