hi there let's talk about society what

is society do you have a definition I

often hear people say that we all have

certain obligations towards society so

what is it then it is a group of people

is it everyone within a given area is it

a so called nation or state is it a

county or a smaller part of the nation

is it your town or perhaps your

neighborhood what size is the right size

for society

maybe Dunbar's number can be useful

there's a scientific study on human

relationships with each other that led

to the so called Dunbar's number through

research it was proposed that humans can

comfortably maintain only 150 stable

relationships the studies actually show

numbers between 100 to 250 people in

other words that's the order of

magnitude perhaps your society is

Dunbar's number or it's like a bigger

number including the people you interact

with frequently say a few thousand maybe

society itself is not a physical object

that you can touch your examine it is a

construct of the mind and ask your

abstract concept and so every person on

the planet will have his or her own

understanding of what society is you

define or society is for you which

people in it Falls and what your

commitments are to those people no

authority can tell you exactly what

society is and what your obligations are

to society and that leads to two other

questions

what is Authority and what is obligation

what is Authority is already covered in

another video on this channel perhaps

the next will be one about obligation
